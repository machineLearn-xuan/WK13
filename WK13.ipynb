    "### Make It Harder\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network models can seem simple to explain in a general sense: they're long and wide computation graphs made up of simple operations that have been tuned to achieve a specific task. Once they're training, or trained, their details and specificities are a little less easy to describe. It's hard to know exactly what each neuron is doing, and what part of the computation they are responsible for. We can train the same network, with the same parameters, using the same input data, and end up with wildly different results.\n",

    "This is one reason why it's hard to debug a network when it doesn't seem to be learning properly, or when it starts to overfit and memorize the training data. Which neurons do we tune ?\n",
    "\n",
    "One common situation that can lead to overfitting is when a network ends up with parameters that make it perform well on the training data without really activating all of its neurons. This is usually what is happening if adding layers to a network doesn't improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One set of strategies for improving neural network training in these cases involves making the training process harder than it has to be. It's like we're challenging the neural network to learn more than it has, so that later it has an easier time with the regular data.\n",

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple technique to achieve this is to add `Dropout` layers to our network. A `Dropout` layer is a layer of neurons that don't perform any mathematical operation, but are selectively dropped out of the network randomly during training. This has the effect of randomly changing the network's architecture during training and preventing the network from becoming too reliant on specific neurons. Instead, it encourages the network to learn more robust features by activating more diverse sets of neurons.\n",

    "### Every pixel is connected to every other pixel\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the first layer after the input layer: every neuron gets information about every pixel. This means that the content at the top-left corner of our image is connected to the content at the bottom-right corner, which is inefficient. We probably don't need our network to consider the entire content of the image at once in order to make decisions. It jumbles the pixel order and just makes the process harder. We might be better off telling our network to consider groups of neighboring pixels, since it's most likely for visual features to come from pixels that are near each other. In other words, we want to extract and preserve some kind of relative _Locality_ from our pixels.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say our network learned how to classify an Arnold Schwarzenegger that's closer to the left side of the image. If it wants to detect Arnolds on the right side of the image, or towards the top, it has to learn how to activate neurons that are associated with those sections of the image. This is also inefficient because it has to relearn to detect the same thing again, just because it's somewhere else in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, what we would like to do is group neighboring pixels, and have the groups go through similar neurons, so that any kind of learning can be applied independent of where shapes are located in the image. The technical name for this property is _Translation Invariance_."
